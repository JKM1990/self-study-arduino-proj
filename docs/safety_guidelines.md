# Project Safety Guidelines

## General Safety Protocols
- Always verify voltage before connecting to components
- Limit current with appropriate resistors
- Ensure proper power stability
- Disconnect power before modifying circuits
- Keep workspace clean and organized
- Have a fire extinguisher nearby
- Never leave powered projects unattended

## Phase-Specific Safety Guidelines

### Phase 1: Setup and Basics
- Verify component ratings before use
- Use proper grounding techniques
- Prevent short circuits with careful wiring
- Use current-limiting resistors with LEDs
- Double-check connections before powering on

### Phase 2: Motor Control
- Monitor motor current limits
- Check temperature during operation
- Ensure adequate power supply rating
- Use heatsinks with motor drivers
- Keep fingers away from moving parts
- Secure loose wires that could get caught

### Phase 3: Dual-Axis System
- Implement mechanical safety guards
- Add emergency stops
- Prevent axis overrun with software limits
- Secure mechanical components
- Test movements at slow speeds first

### Phase 4: System Assembly and Testing
- Perform regular system-wide safety checks
- Test performance under load incrementally
- Implement error recovery procedures
- Ensure stable mounting of all components
- Verify all fasteners are secure

## Emergency Procedures
1. **In case of smoke or fire:**
   - Immediately disconnect power
   - Use fire extinguisher if safe to do so
   - Evacuate if necessary

2. **In case of electrical shock:**
   - Cut power at source
   - Do not touch person until power is off
   - Seek medical attention

3. **In case of mechanical injury:**
   - Stop all movement
   - Disconnect power
   - Seek medical attention if needed

*Always prioritize safety over project progress. When in doubt, stop and reassess.*
