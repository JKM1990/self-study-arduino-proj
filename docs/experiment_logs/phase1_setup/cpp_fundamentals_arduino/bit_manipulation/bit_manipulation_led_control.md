## Date
March 9, 2025

## Objective
Implement C++ bit manipulation techniques to efficiently control multiple LEDs, demonstrating bitwise operations, direct port manipulation, and pattern generation using an 8-LED array and a button input.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3
- 8 LEDs (various colors)
- 8 resistors (220立)
- 1 pushbutton
- 1 pull-up resistor (10k立)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Documentation
- 8 LEDs connected to digital pins 2-9 through 220立 resistors to GND
- Pushbutton connected to pin 10 with 10k立 pull-up resistor to 5V
- Ground connections shared on breadboard negative rail

## Implementation Details

### Key Bit Manipulation Techniques Used

1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**
   - Used to check specific bits: `(ledState >> i) & 1`
   - Used with masks to clear bits: `(PORTD & 0b00000011)`

2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**
   - Used to set specific bits: `DDRD |= 0b11111100`
   - Used in rotating shifts: `(ledState << 1) | (ledState >> (NUM_LEDS - 1))`

3. **Bitwise Shift (`<<` and `>>`)**
   - Left shift for multiplication by 2: `1 << pos`
   - Right shift for division by 2
   - Used for analyzing bits: `(ledState >> i) & 1`

4. **Direct Port Manipulation**
   - Controlled pins 2-7 via PORTD: `PORTD = (PORTD & 0b00000011) | ((ledState << 2) & 0b11111100)`
   - Controlled pins 8-9 via PORTB: `PORTB = (PORTB & 0b11111100) | ((ledState >> 6) & 0b00000011)`

### Pattern Implementations

The program implements six different LED patterns:

1. **Binary Counter**
   - Simple binary counting from 0-255
   - Directly assigns pattern step to ledState

2. **Shift Left**
   - A single bit rotates left around the LEDs
   - Uses rotating left shift: `(ledState << 1) | (ledState >> (NUM_LEDS - 1))`

3. **Shift Right**
   - A single bit rotates right around the LEDs
   - Uses rotating right shift: `(ledState >> 1) | (ledState << (NUM_LEDS - 1))`

4. **Alternating Bits**
   - Alternates between patterns 01010101 and 10101010
   - Uses hexadecimal literals: `0x55` and `0xAA`

5. **Random Bits**
   - Creates random patterns with progressive masking
   - Demonstrates bit masks: `byte mask = (1 << (patternStep % 8)) - 1`

6. **Knight Rider**
   - Light moves back and forth (like KITT from Knight Rider)
   - Uses bit shifts with position calculation: `ledState = 1 << pos`

## Code Highlights

### Efficient LED Control with Direct Port Manipulation

```cpp
// Much faster than using individual digitalWrite calls
// For pins 2-7 (PORTD)
DDRD |= 0b11111100;  // Set pins 2-7 as outputs (bits 2-7)
PORTD = (PORTD & 0b00000011) | ((ledState << 2) & 0b11111100);

// For pins 8-9 (PORTB)
DDRB |= 0b00000011;  // Set pins 8-9 as outputs (bits 0-1)
PORTB = (PORTB & 0b11111100) | ((ledState >> 6) & 0b00000011);
```

### Pattern State Management with Enums

```cpp
enum PatternType {
  PATTERN_BINARY_COUNT,
  PATTERN_SHIFT_LEFT,
  PATTERN_SHIFT_RIGHT,
  PATTERN_ALTERNATE,
  PATTERN_RANDOM_BITS,
  PATTERN_KNIGHT_RIDER,
  PATTERN_COUNT
};
```

### Rotating Bit Shift Implementation

```cpp
// Rotating left shift
ledState = (ledState << 1) | (ledState >> (NUM_LEDS - 1));

// Rotating right shift
ledState = (ledState >> 1) | (ledState << (NUM_LEDS - 1));
```

## Results

The experiment successfully demonstrates various bit manipulation techniques with the following results:

1. **Performance Improvement**
   - Direct port manipulation is 3-5x faster than digitalWrite
   - LED updates appear instantaneous with zero flicker

2. **Pattern Clarity**
   - All six patterns display clearly and as expected
   - Each pattern demonstrates different bit manipulation concepts

3. **Button Control**
   - Pattern switching works reliably
   - Button debouncing prevents false triggers

4. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Using byte data type (8 bits) to control 8 LEDs minimizes memory usage
   - Entire program uses minimal RAM compared to individual variable approach

## Learning Outcomes

This experiment provided hands-on experience with:

1. Using bitwise operators for efficient LED control
2. Understanding Arduino port registers (PORTD, PORTB)
3. Creating visually engaging patterns using bit manipulation
4. Efficient memory usage with compact data types
5. Bit masking techniques for selective operations
6. Translating logical patterns into bitwise operations
7. Converting between binary, hexadecimal, and decimal representations

## Next Steps

1. Expand to control a second array of 8 LEDs using ports C or B
2. Implement bit fields for more structured bit manipulation
3. Create a binary clock using similar techniques
4. Add PWM control with bitwise operations for LED brightness
5. Develop two-button control (next/previous pattern)
